# biosciences-research

Competency questions catalog, graph-builder workflows, and research outputs for the Open Biosciences platform.

Part of the [Open Biosciences](https://github.com/open-biosciences) multi-repo platform.

## Status

**Wave 4 (Validation) — migration pending.** This repository is a target for Wave 4 of the platform migration. Content will be migrated from the predecessor `lifesciences-research` repo once Waves 1-3 are complete.

## What Will Be Here

- Competency questions catalog (CQ1-CQ15+) — structured research questions that drive platform capabilities
- Graph-builder workflow definitions for constructing knowledge subgraphs
- Research outputs and validation reports
- Reference materials and domain documentation
