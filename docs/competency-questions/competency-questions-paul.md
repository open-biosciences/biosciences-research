# Competency Questions - Paul Zamora, DMV Petri Dish

The following is a list of competency questions designed to support Paul's research, focusing on clinical outcomes, established drugs (like Doxorubicin), the tumor microenvironment, and the lung work's targeted approach.

## Focus Area 1: Anchoring Research in Clinical and Target Outcomes (Doxorubicin)

These questions aim to use Doxorubicin's well-established profile as a benchmark for validation and to address the core problem of toxicity and resistance.

cq1. What are the clinically documented side effects of Doxorubicin on heart cells, and what are the specific molecular mechanisms believed to cause this cardiotoxicity?

cq2. What are the established escape mechanisms used by tumors that initially respond to Doxorubicin therapy but subsequently fail, and what are the corresponding secondary therapies designed to overcome this resistance?

cq3. What known genes or pathways are implicated in minimizing Doxorubicin toxicity while preserving its anti-tumor efficacy?

cq4. Using existing clinical trial data, what is the correlation between pre-clinical findings on Doxorubicin resistance mechanisms and the actual disease outcomes observed in patients?

## Focus Area 2: Tumor Microenvironment and Mechanisms of Evasion

These questions are designed to explore the evolving area of the tumor's interaction with its environment, requiring the use of domain-specific terminology.

cq5. How does the tumor hijack the immune system to create an evasion mechanism, and what specific factors does it secrete to inhibit immune response or stimulate its own growth?

cq6. What are the key differences in gene expression (or a "different set of genes") that trigger metastasis versus those involved in maintaining a localized tumor?

cq7. What is the pharmacological mechanism by which a tumor secretes proteases to break down the local environment and gain access to the blood?

## Focus Area 3: Lung Work and Targeted Approach (Synthetic Lethality)

These questions reflect the current research pivot and the need for a highly targeted approach for the agent skill tools to manage complex "Omix stuff."

cq8. What specific drug candidates demonstrate efficacy in targeting both mutant and wild type cells with high efficiency for NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer), a known research interest?

cq9. What existing literature, patents, and clinical trials define the current state of art for synthetic lethality approaches in lung cancer?

## Focus Area 4: Method and Approach (Validating LLM Reasoning)

These questions are framed to validate the LLM's ability to reason, using a "graph-like terminology" and following the pharmacological method.

cq10. What are the iterative steps and criteria for storing research and identifying prior and emerging art in clinical trials as required by the established pharmacological method?

cq11. How can very tight data be pulled from a selection of Omix databases to validate identifiers and cross-references for a specific protein or gene pathway, and how can this be scaled for larger number-crunching later?

cq12. Using a structured (graph-like) format, explain the full line of reasoning that correlates a specific gene's resolution, protein enrichment, interaction expansion, drug finding, and corresponding clinical trial history.
